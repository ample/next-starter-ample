<Meta title="Components/Button" component={Button} />

# Button

Let's define a story for our `Button` component:

<Story name="Button one">
  <Button url="/docs/">Button One</Button>
</Story>

We can drop it in a `Preview` to get a code snippet:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Button Two">
    <Button url="/docs/">Button Two</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>

We can even preview multiple stories in a block. This
gets rendered as a group, but defines individual stories
with unique URLs and isolated snapshot tests.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Default theme">
    <Button url="/docs/">Default theme</Button>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Outline theme">
    <Button url="/docs/" theme="outline">
      Outline theme
    </Button>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Arrow theme">
    <Button url="/docs/" theme="arrow">
      Arrow theme
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>
